/**
 * 	Facilitates creating custom bezier eases with the GreenSock Custom Ease Builder tool. It's essentially
 *  a place to store the bezier segment information for each ease instead of recreating it inside each
 *  function call which would slow things down. Please use the interactive tool available at 
 *  http://blog.greensock.com/customease/ to generate the necessary code.
